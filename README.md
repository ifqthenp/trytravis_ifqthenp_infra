## :diamonds: Homework 4. GCP Infrastructure

### SSH aliases

Use this configuration in your `~/.ssh/config` file to gain SSH access
to an inner private network via `bastion` public host.

```shell
Host bastion
    Hostname 35.230.132.206
    User appuser
    ForwardAgent yes
Host someinternalhost
    Hostname 10.154.0.3
    User appuser
    ProxyCommand ssh -qxT bastion nc %h %p
```

Alternative solution: `ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p bastion`

### Connection configuration

bastion_IP = 35.230.132.206
someinternalhost_IP = 10.154.0.3

To check  OpenVPN server connection:

```shell
sudo apt-get install openvpn
sudo openvpn --config /path/to/config.ovpn
ssh -i ~/.ssh/appuser appuser@< inner private network IP >
```

## :diamonds: Homework 5. Testapp deploy to GCP

### Testapp connection config

testapp_IP = 35.197.215.51
testapp_port = 9292

### GCP startup script

Use this script to automate application deployment to GCP using a [local startup script file][1] and [gcloud][2] command-line tool.

```shell
gcloud compute instances create reddit-app \
--boot-disk-size=10GB \
--image-family ubuntu-1604-lts \
--image-project=ubuntu-os-cloud \
--machine-type=g1-small \
--tags puma-server \
--restart-on-failure \
--metadata-from-file startup-script=startup_script.sh
```

To deploy application with a remote startup script stored on GCP use [startup-script-url][3].

```shell
gcloud compute instances create reddit-app \
--boot-disk-size=10GB \
--image-family ubuntu-1604-lts \
--image-project=ubuntu-os-cloud \
--machine-type=g1-small \
--tags puma-server \
--restart-on-failure \
--scopes storage-ro \
--metadata startup-script-url=gs://otus-devops-storage/startup_script.sh
```

### Firewall rules for puma server

Create a Google Compute Engine [firewall rule][4] using `gcloud` tool.

```shell
gcloud compute firewall-rules create default-puma-server \
--allow tcp:9292 \
--target-tags puma-server
```

Delete Google Compute Engine [firewall rules][5] using `gcloud` tool.

```shell
gcloud compute firewall-rules delete default-puma-server
```

## :diamonds: Homework 6. Creating GCP VM instances with HashiCorp Packer

### Completed tasks

:large_blue_diamond: Added packer builder template `ubuntu16.json` parameterized with `variables.json`. The latter has been added to `.gitignore` and `variables.json.example` will be pushed to the repo instead of original file with user variables.

To validate the syntax and configuration of a template use `packer validate` command:

```shell
packer validate -var-file=variables.json ubuntu16.json
```

:large_blue_diamond: Extra options for packer builder have been added to `variables.json` file

- disk_type
- disk_size
- network
- tags
- image_description

:large_orange_diamond: Created "baked" `reddit-full` image ready to be used in immutable infrastructure. The `immutable.json` template includes `puma-reddit.service` provisioning file and `puma-reddit_setup.sh` script enabling application to start as `systemd` unit. To build "baked" image using `packer` image run

```shell
packer build immutable.json
```

To create new VM instance based on `reddit-full` image with live reddit application run

```shell
./config-scripts/create-reddit.sh
```

### Useful commands

Copy and execute script using SSH on remote host. This command is handy for puma server deploy when a new VM instance created with `reddit-base` image.

```shell
ssh appuser@< REMOTE_IP > "bash -s" < ./config-scripts/deploy.sh
```

## :diamonds: Homework 7. IaC with Terraform

- :large_blue_diamond: Created terraform configuration files `main.tf`, `outputs.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `terraform.tfvars` allowing reddit application to be deployed on GCP instance. Input variables have been defined in `terraform.tfvars` and `terraform.tfvars.example` file has been pushed to the repo
- :large_orange_diamond: Added terraform resource to manage GCP SSH keys on project level. The problem encountered with this approach is that terraform will rewrite all previously added keys and `terraform destroy` command will delete all keys from project metadata.

## :diamonds: Homework 8. Terraform resources, modules, environment, and teamwork

- :large_blue_diamond: Created terraform modularized configuration. The modules are `app`, `db`, and `vpc`
- :large_blue_diamond: Parameterized modules with custom variables
- :large_blue_diamond: Created Stage and Prod environments for modules configuration reuse
- :large_blue_diamond: Created file `storage-bucket.tf` with `storage-bucket` module configuration
- :large_orange_diamond: Added `backend.tf` config file to store terraform state on Google Cloud Storage platform
- :large_orange_diamond: Checked that state file is reachable in the bucket from different folders on the machine
- :large_orange_diamond: Added provisioning files to the modules `app` and `db`

## :diamonds: Homework 9. Introduction to Ansible

### Completed tasks

- :large_blue_diamond: Installed Ansible control machine to execute Ansible tasks from
- :large_blue_diamond: Created inventory files in various formats: `ini`, `yml`, `json`
- :large_blue_diamond: Created `ansible.cfg` config file with default values for the project
- :large_blue_diamond: Created simple ansible playbook to test ansible behaviour for repeating tasks
- :large_orange_diamond: Created simple ansible playbook, described in `clone.yml`, to test ansible behaviour for repeating tasks. The tests have shown that multiple identical commands sent with ansible to the server have the same effect as single command sent to server only once, i.e. ansible module `command` is idempotent.

## :diamonds: Homework 10. Deployment and configuration management with Ansible

### Completed tasks

- :large_blue_diamond: Created several ansible playbooks for Reddit application deployment
  - `reddit_app_one_play` contains all necessary tasks for deployment in one play separated with tags
  - `reddit_app_multiple_plays` has the same functionality as playbook above but divided in three plays
  - `app.yml`, `db.yml`, and `deploy.yml` are three playbooks containing tasks for specific group of hosts. The playbooks imported in `site.yml` in predefined order to deploy Reddit application.
  - `packer_db.yml` and `packer_app.yml` are the playbooks for packer images provisioning using ansible
- :large_blue_diamond: Changed provisioning config in `packer/app.json` and `packer/db.json` to replace bash scripts with ansible playbooks
- :large_orange_diamond: Created configuration for dynamic inventory using `gce.py`

### Useful commands

```shell
ansible all -m ping
ansible-playbook site.yml --check
ansible-playbook site.yml
```

### Completed tasks

- :large_blue_diamond: Created Ansible `app` and `db` roles with `ansible-galaxy init` command and assigned default variables for roles
- :large_blue_diamond: Created environments for stage and production with variables defined using Ansible `group_vars`. Added tasks for the `app` and `db` roles to display the environments they belong to
- :large_blue_diamond: Installed `jdauphant.nginx` community role with `ansible-galaxy` and configured Ansible to allow Reddit application to be reachable on port `80`. The appropriate firewall rule has been added to Terraform configuration
- :large_blue_diamond: Organised playbooks according to Ansible [best practices][17]
- :large_blue_diamond: Created `credentials.yml` for each environment and encrypted its content using `ansible-vault`
- :large_orange_diamond: Configured dynamic inventory for `stage` and `prod` environments using `gce.py`
- :large_orange_diamond: Configured `trytravis` for local repository testing in Travis CI
